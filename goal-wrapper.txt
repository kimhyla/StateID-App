Implement a minimal redirect endpoint and tests.

Requirements:
- Route: GET /r?u=<url>
- Missing or empty "u" -> 400 { "error": "missing target" }
- Only allow http/https targets; otherwise 400 { "error": "invalid target" }
- On valid target: respond 302 with Location header set to the target; preserve query string
- Fail-open: attempt a ledgerWrite() inside try/catch; if it throws, still return 302 (do not crash).
  - For tests, if process.env.LEDGER_THROW === "true", ledgerWrite throws.
- Logging: when LOG_REQUESTS is "true" or "1", include x-request-id (from header or generate) AND duration ms in the log line:
  e.g. "GET /r -> 302 id=<cid> dur=<ms>"
- No new deps. Node 22 ESM. One batched edit touching only:
  - src/server.js
  - test/redirect.test.js (new)
- Tests must cover:
  1) 302 for http target (redirect: 'manual' to inspect Location)
  2) 302 for https target
  3) 400 for missing u
  4) 400 for non-http schemes (e.g. javascript:)
  5) 302 even when LEDGER_THROW="true" (fail-open)

Stop after running /test.
