Read docs/spec/mvp.md and produce a concrete plan as docs only (no code changes):

Create:
1) docs/plan/roadmap.md — 8–12 milestones from MVP:
   - Scope & user outcomes
   - Acceptance criteria (testable)
   - Key dependencies
   - T-shirt size + rough effort (person-days)
   - Branch naming (feat/<slug>) and PR checkpoints

2) docs/plan/risks.md — top risks & mitigations (tech, product, privacy, calendar edge cases),
   with risk level & owner.

3) docs/plan/test-matrix.md — what we will test and where (unit, integration, end-to-end),
   including calendar rewrite cases (Google/Outlook), wrapper p95 latency, fail-open, and exports.

4) docs/arch/overview.md — high-level architecture:
   - Wrapper/redirect service
   - Calendar rewriter (Google/Graph)
   - Desktop agent
   - Ledger & export (local Named Audit Pack)
   - Data shapes and boundaries
   - Feature flags/kill switches; observability

Rules:
- Do NOT touch src/ or tests/.
- Keep it actionable and tied to MVP acceptance criteria.
- Include a two-week Sprint 1 cut with concrete tasks we can do immediately.

Stop after writing the docs.
