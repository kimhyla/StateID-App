Refactor to load IDs from data/ids.json at startup instead of hardcoding.
- Keep existing behavior for:
  * GET /ids
  * GET /ids/:id
  * GET /ids/search (case-insensitive, supports ?limit=, "q" or "query", 400 on empty)
- If the file is missing/invalid, respond 500 {"error":"data load failed"} for those endpoints (server still starts).
- No new deps; use fs/promises.
One batched edit; then run /test and stop.
