Implement GET /ids/search in src/server.js to pass tests:
- If query param "query" is missing or only whitespace, return 400 with JSON { "error": "query required" }.
- Otherwise, case-insensitive match "query" against each item's id or name.
- Response: 200 with { items: [ ...matched items... ] }.
Do not add new deps. Keep Node 22 ESM style. One batched edit touching only src/server.js and tests if needed. Then stop.
